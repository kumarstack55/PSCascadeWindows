# PSCascadeWindows

This PowerShell script cascades all visible windows on the desktop.

## Motivation

Starting with Windows 11, Microsoft no longer provides a built-in feature for cascading windows.

<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/5516749/cascade-windows-11>

> Windows 11 doesnâ€™t include a built-in "Cascade Windows" option like previous versions, but you can use Snap Layouts to quickly organize your open apps on the screen.

Cascade windows are useful when the screen is narrow, to view more of the last line or so of each window, or for other reasons.

In addition, compared to the Cascade windows that Windows used to provide by default, it would be even better if cascade windows could be implemented as follows.

- When displaying windows in cascade view, make the top-right corner of each window wider to allow access to the window behind it. Make it wider than the close button to prevent accidentally closing the window.
- We want to display the last line of the terminal in cascaded windows.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Windows 11
  - Windows PowerShell 5.1+

## Usage

```powershell
# powershell

git clone https://github.com/kumarstack55/PSCascadeWindows.git

Set-Location .\PSCascadeWindows\
.\Invoke-CascadeWindows.ps1
```

## More easy way to cascade windows: Shortcut

You can create a shortcut using the following steps.
Double-clicking the created shortcut will cascade windows.

```powershell
# powershell

Set-Location .\PSCascadeWindows\

$location = Get-Location
$gitDirectoryPath = $location.Path
$shortcutPath = Join-Path $gitDirectoryPath "PSCascadeWindows.lnk"
$scriptPath = Join-Path $gitDirectoryPath "Invoke-CascadeWindows.ps1"

$wshShell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell
$shortcut = $wshShell.CreateShortcut($shortcutPath)
$shortcut.TargetPath = "powershell.exe"
$shortcut.Arguments = "-NoProfile -File `"$scriptPath`""
$shortcut.WindowStyle = 7  # Minimized, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/admin-development/create-desktop-shortcut-with-wsh
$shortcut.Save()

Start-Process $gitDirectoryPath
```
